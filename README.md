# Christmas Card

## Why?

I wanted to build a virtual christmas card but man does doing any type of artistic coding really hurt.

## How?

This was generated, in large part, by ChatGPT 4. A full transcript of the prompts used are here: "Just kidding. Currently ChatGPT doesn't support sharing chats that include images..."

ChatGPT did the boiler plate and complicated work. I did the finicky and tricky precision work.

## What tech?

This is build in P5.js, html, and JavaScript.
